        <p>
          I am a well organised, hardworking and determined student approaching
          the conclusion of my BTEC Nationals of Computing at Ron Dearing UTC
          with predicted grades of D*D*D.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm approaching the end of my two year course at Ron Dearing UTC in
          Hull. In which I have learnt a lot about Web Development and UX
          Design. Now, I'm finally ready to take my first steps into the
          industry.

        <p>
          Hi, my name is Mason Garrod. I'm 18 and currently working towards my
          skills in Web Developement and UX Design, and wish to undergo careers
          in either of these paths as they closely relate to eachother in their
          design functionalities. My passion for these subjects started when I
          began two modules: Human-Computer Interaction and Web Development,
          both introduced me to creativity I never thought I had.
        </p>

            The course I am taking is the Level 3 BTEC Nationals in Computing, I
            am doing an Extended Diploma meaning my predicted grade of D*D*D
            will be equivalent to 3 A-Levels. Additionally, I've also learnt
            alot about different topics during my time on the course, such as:
            Principles and the Fundamentals of Computer Science, Game
            Development, App Development and other modules which have opened my
            mind to other amazing technologies.

            <h3>The 55 Group: Invoice Dashboard</h3>
            <p>
              In this Project, I applied for 1 week of work experience with The
              55 Group, a Web/Software development company based in Hull. While
              working with other students from my classes, we were exposed to
              JavaScript frameworks Vue.js and Node.js. In unison, the team
              created a functioning dashboard with all the essential features of
              a business's invoice system.
